# use this for Tasks 3 - 8 https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py
# Task 3: Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

# Task 10: Technical interview preparation:

	You are not allowed to google anything
	Whiteboard first
	This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
	Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

	Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
	Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

# Task 11: Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using write.
# Task 12: Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

# The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE

# The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)

# Task 12: Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
